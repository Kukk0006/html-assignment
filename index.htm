    <p> <!-- 2 paragraphs est 50 words each-->
      I'm from Thornton, Colorado, and I have been a resident in Ontario for 8 years now.  I've lived in Markham and Peterborough. I have been in Ottawa since the start of 2019. I don't plan on staying in Ottawa in the long term, but don't have any idea where I want to go next.  I have 2 years <em> at least</em> to figure that out.  
    </p>

      <p>I grew up with a creative family.  My mom taught me to sew and explore historical costuming. While my dad did some historical reenactment through the <abbr title="Society For Creative Anachronism">SCA</abbr> and he was in a many bands while I was growing up.
